                  Locking up your Sculpt VC screen

Using [https://genode.org/download/sculpt - Sculpt] on my working machine as
day-to-day OS became quite comfortable. Still, some inconvenient stayed. One
specific one appeared whenever I started for lunch - I wanted to lock the
screen. Currently, this functionality is missing - because of that I had
to power down my machine during lunch. Obviously, this is annoying - so I
started to investigate how to solve the issue.

In principle the solution with nitpicker, our low complexity GUI multiplexer,
should be straight forward. Just add a domain which is layered above the other
domains. Whenever a lock screen component - I named it nit_lock - gets
activated, it will be displayed full-screen above all other domains. Of course,
you have to explicitly admit it by a policy entry on nitpicker. Additionally,
any input must go to this component. As soon as you provide your unlock
passphrase, the nit_lock component is done and give back your screen.

The first prototype of it is already ready and used on a daily basis by me.

The main downside of the approach is that you need to patch the sculpt policy
and thereby has to build the image by your own.

You are adventurous ? Then read ahead.

If you want to try yourself then you have to follow the instructions for 
[https://genode.org/documentation/articles/sculpt-vc#Building_the_boot_image - building the boot image] of Sculpt VC
and you have to incorporate the
[https://github.com/alex-ab/genode/commit/ac29f796d58e2250b5f29e28bcbfb8a8d8b21f0b - nit_lock policy] patch
to your checked out branch - before you do the
! make -C build/x86_64 run/sculpt KERNEL=nova
call - of course ;-).

As you can see from the nit_lock policy patch, the Sculpt VC launcher start
entry supports to configure a password.

! repos/gems/run/sculpt/launcher/lock-screen
!
! <launcher pkg="alex-ab/pkg/nit_lock/2018-11-27">
! 	<config password="" transparent="no"/>
!	<route>
!		<service name="Nitpicker"> <parent label="lock_screen"/> </service>
!	</route>
! </launcher>

You may build the nit_pick package yourself or use my [https://depot.genode.org/alex-ab/pkg/nit_lock - packaged version of nit_lock], as configured in the launcher snippet above.

Regarding the usage:

If you don't provide a password, but actually start the nit_lock component,
the screen will turn red and it will record all your input as onetime password
until you hit enter. Afterwards the screen turns to dark or stays transparent,
depending on your launcher configuration (see above).

To unlock the screen you have to provide the onetime password respectively
the configured password. There is no input field shown, just start typing.

The developer sources can be found on my
[https://github.com/alex-ab/genode/commits/sculpt_pkg_nit_lock_18_11 - nit_lock branch]
for Sculpt VC.

The specific 
[https://github.com/alex-ab/genode/commit/82abfe764bb7f7bd5d4d1721fc64a1b5385aba3d - nit_lock]
implementation can also be tested beforehand via the _nit_lock.run_ script. Just check out
the developer branch and do something similar to

! make -C build/x86_64 KERNEL=nova run/nit_lock

I'm happy about feedback and/or feature requests.
