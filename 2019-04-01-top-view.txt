                 Graphical CPU utilization and monitoring tool

The 'top_view' package is a tool using the [https://genode.org/documentation/release-notes/15.08#Enhanced_tracing_facilities - tracing infrastructure] of Genode to gather thread related information, e.g. execution time, and prepare them
for graphical presentation. I already develop it for a while beginning with
the early Sculpt versions. In the last weeks I extended it in my leisure time
with some extra features, with the goal to selectively monitor behaviour of
components of interest over some time. The main impulse was triggered
during the work on
[http://www.genodians.org/alex-ab/2019-02-13-sculpt-vc-audio - audio on Sculpt],
where I missed a basic online tool that supports me to get better insights
into some behaviour of the system.

In this post I'm going to describe the current (19.04 version) state of the
'top_view' tool and its usage. Since I'm not a GUI developer, I fear some
guidance is necessary... The 'top_view' tool you may find and download from
my alex-ab depot:

On startup you will have to connect the top_view package with a GUI service,
permit access to the tracing infrastructure of Genode and to the fonts fs
service, available in the genodelabs depot.

When the tool starts up, you will get to the initial thread view:

[image top_view_1]

The thread view presents you the threads with the top most CPU utilization
per CPU. The view is updated in a configurable period (see below). The
label column contains the component name and the parent relationship.
A click on the stretched left button will lead you to the 'configuration' view:

The left column with the 'cpu' names allows you to selective enable/disable
the display of utilization information of a specific CPU. The column right aside
with just the numbers allows you to select how many entries per CPU are shown.
Both columns you may scroll up/down by using the '...' buttons or the scroll
wheel of the mouse.

In the upper right you may change the rate of requesting and updating
the trace data. The 5 buttons represent 5 digits of the configurable
period range of 1 to 99999 ms. Left clicks increase the respective digit,
right clicks decrease it.

You may switch between the default 'thread' and 'components' view by selecting
the respective buttons in the upper row. The numbers next to the buttons
denote the overall count of threads and components (processes) in the running
Genode system. Selecting the component view, you will get to the next view:

[image top_view_3]

In the 'components' view all components (processes) are listed. You may scroll
up/down by using the '...' entries or the scroll wheel. According to the
selected CPU in the left column, the overall utilization of the
threads of a component on the specific CPU is shown. By changing the CPU,
you may get the utilization of the other component threads on that specific CPU.
The column with just the numbers allows you to select how many components at
once are shown.

A click on the thread and label names will lead you to the
detailed component view:

[image top_view_4]

In the detailed component view you get information specific to a selected
component. The view presents you all threads of a component and the
CPU affinity of them. Additionally, further information regarding scheduling,
like priority and quantum, and kernel memory usage can be available. (It is
in a developer version already, but the feature request for upstream got
not considered yet.)

The checkbox next to each thread will mark a thread to be tracked over
some time. Toggling such a checkbox leads you to an additional 'graph'
window:

[image top_view_5]

The 'graph' window shows all tracked threads and their CPU utilization per
reading point. The vertical scale denotes the utilization in percent and will
be adjusted automatically to the utilization of the tracked threads. Hovering
above one reading point with the mouse pointer shows the thread and utilization 
information in place. The 'graph' window is resizeable and can be adjusted
dynamically by you.

You may selective de-select tracked threads in the detailed component view
or may de-select all threads at once by using the reset graph button in the
'configuration' view. Whenever no threads are selected for tracking, the
graph window will disappear.

Known issues
------------

The window size of the menu is sometimes not adjusted correctly after
switching views. A click on the lower right window decoration leads to
the right size, typically. Sometimes, when you scroll down quickly, the menu
view is not updated completly. If you are just patience, it will be with
the next redraw, typically.

Top_view background
-------------------

The top view package consists of three Genode components running in a 
sub init. The 'top' component gather the trace data and prepare it for
the other two components, the' menu_view' and the 'graph'. Top generates in
the configured period Genode reports understood by the menu_view and by the
graph component.
The menu_view is a modified version of the menu_view as used also in the
Leitzentrale and shows the thread, component, configuration and detailed view.
The 'graph' component is a native GUI/Nitpicker client which presents you
with the second window about the tracked threads.
