                    Firefox &amp; Thunderbird VM for Sculpt 23.04

With the [https://genode.org/download/sculpt - Sculpt 23.04]
release several ready-to-use VMs powered by Seoul VMM got updated to the
latest version.

Disposal Firefox VM
-------------------

The
[https://www.genodians.org/alex-ab/2019-03-06-disposal-browser-vm - disposal Firefox VM package]
got updated to the latest [http://tinycorelinux.net - Tinycore] 14 version and
contains the current Firefox 112 version. Thanks to the added
[https://genode.org/documentation/release-notes/22.11#Seoul_VMM - Virtio support]
for audio, gpu(2D) and input in 2021-2022, the user experience got improved
compared to former Seoul versions. Additionally, the
[https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock - uBlock Origin Add-on] is now part of the
VM, to manage/block advertisements effectively.

Thunderbird VM
--------------

Additionally, I provide a ready-to-use Thunderbird VM based upon Tinycore 14.
In constrast to the disposal Firefox VM, the Thunderbird VM stores the
home folder of the VM as a separated virtual disk, so changes can persist.
During setup of the thunderbird@seoul package, a file_system service is
requested, where the virtual disk with name block.vdi is looked for. If not
existent, an empty block.vdi will be imported from the thunderbird@seoul
package. This virtual disk is mounted as /home/tc in the Thunderbird VM on
boot.

Whenever newer versions of Firefox & Thunderbird appear, I update most the
time quite promptly.

In case of the Thunderbird VM, the previous mail configuration and downloaded
mails are kept, due to the virtual disk support. Unfortunately, Thunderbird
seems to create a new profile after each update, so that your configuration
seems to be gone.

If this happens to you, open a shell in the Thunderbird VM and issue:

! thunderbird -p

Here you can select your previous profile and make it default again.

If you miss after an update your window decorations & buttons, use

Ctrl-Alt-M

once to twice to get them back.
