                     Screencast on Sculpt OS

From time-to-time the
[https://github.com/genodelabs/genode/issues/1806 - screen cast]
support on Genode pops up. Martin successfully ported
avconv and demonstrated it
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeBvog_ZoXM - back then in 2016].
In the event of Sculpt OS, I lately had the chance to update the port and
integrate it with Sculpt OS in form of packages ready for use. The
following instructions will guide you through the setup. Additionally a short
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wKmpCrWSxI - video] recorded running on Sculpt
is available.

In order to run the screen cast version of Sculpt OS, you will need to download
the experimental branch alex-ab/sculpt_avconv_19_11 and build the Sculpt image
yourself. Clone  

! git clone https://github.com/alex-ab/genode
! cd genode
! git checkout sculpt_avconv_19_11

and adjust to the rest of the instructions for
[https://genode.org/documentation/articles/sculpt-19-07#Building_the_boot_image - building the boot image]
and/or watch the short video about
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7g8hDQQt-VI - building the Sculpt OS image].

After booting your new sculpt image, you can find the avconv tool via

! +
!   -> Depot
!      -> alex-ab
!        -> Experimental
!          -> avconv
!          -> avplay

On startup of 'avonv' you will have to connect to a Framebuffer service,
choose the 'raw framebuffer access'. Additionally, the 'avonv' component needs
a storage location to save the recording. When started successfully, the
avconv tool will create a file named out.avi and will record everything you
are now doing. You may stop 'avconv' by removing it from the
component graph.

If you now want to watch your recording, you may do so by using the 'avplay'
package. The 'avplay' component expects a file named 'mediafile', a GUI service
and an audio service. As shown in the video, use the 'inspect' feature to mount
the file system and make a copy of the 'out.avi' file and name it 'mediafile'.
After installing an audio driver, e.g. shown in the video, you can start
'avplay'. After you connected it to all required services, you may watch your
recording finally.

As final note, please consider this version of the Sculpt image as
experimental. You may use all provided packages without
further changes, but don't use it for productive/daily use
- just for recordings ;-).

Known issues
------------

If your 'avconv' component does not start and complains about a missing
'vfs_lxfb.lib.so" ROM, then you may have in your backup/restored
config/deploy a line about 'vfs.lib.so'. Comment the line out, save your config
and reboot your image.
