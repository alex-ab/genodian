    x86 CPU frequency and power steering with Sculpt 23.10

With Sculpt 23.10 the previous
[https://genodians.org/alex-ab/2023-05-29-freq_power - sneak peek] feature
got integrated into the Genode base framework and hence is readily
available with the new Sculpt OS release.

Intro
-----

As described in the previous sneak peek article, CPU vendors provide features
for the operating system to influence frequency and power consumption, like Intel
HWP or AMD pstate to name just some of them. Some of the features require at
the lowest level access to selected 
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-specific_register - MSR] CPU registers,
which can solely by accessed by privileged rdmsr/wrmsr instructions available
to the kernel.

With this release we add the general support to the Genode base framework,
to add guarded access to selected MSRs via Genode's system_control RPC of the
protection domain (PD) session. If the underlying kernel supports this
feature, as now done for the NOVA kernel, read and write requests are forwarded
by Genode's roottask to the kernel. A component needs the explicit 
"managing_system" Genode configuration permission to get access to this
functionality, which is by default not granted.

The
[https://github.com/alex-ab/genode-chest/tree/main/src/app/msr - MSR component]
is an component using the Pd::system_control interface, with which it monitors
and reports changes of registers for temperature and frequency (AMD & Intel)
and power consumption (Intel). Additionally, the component can be instructed
by configuration changes to write some of the registers. Beside the quite
low level MSR component, a Genode package with an additional graphical
component is provided to make the interactive usage of the feature user
friendly. All sources and package recipes are available via
[https://github.com/alex-ab/genode-chest/tree/main - my github repository].

Usage
-----

Two MSR packages, one with and without GUI, are provided via the alex-ab depot.

After enabling the 'alex-ab' depot via

! +
!   -> Depot
!      -> Selection
!         -> alex-ab

one can choose one of the two packages to be installed:
 
! +
!   -> Depot
!      -> alex-ab
!         -> CPU frequency and temperature (Intel and AMD)
!            -> msr tool (with GUI)
!            -> msr tool (no GUI)


During configuration, the resource dialog must be selected and the
permission "System control" must be granted so that the packages can operate
properly, as described before in the introduction.

[image msr_config]

If the extra permission got forgotten, the packages will complain, e.g.:

! [init -> runtime -> msr] Error: - CPU or used kernel misses MSR access support
! [init -> runtime -> msr] Error: - and/or missing 'managing_system' configuration

After the first successful start, the tool will show all CPUs with their
current frequency and temperature.

By choosing the button left of the CPUs, the settings menu can be opened and
closed:

[image msr_rapl]

In the menu you can change the update frequency of the tool with right/left
mouse clicks on the number buttons.
If Intel HWP is still off, (if disabled in '/boot/grub/grub.cfg'), you may
enable it once. According to the Intel specification, it can't be disabled
afterwards until reset. In the normal settings mode, you can choose between
performance, balanced and power-saving mode. Your changes will be effective
as soon as you press the apply to 'all CPUs' button at the bottom.
If the CPU supports 'Intel Running Average Power Limit Energy Reporting'
technology, the power consumption for various domains will be shown.

Additionally, you may enable the 'advanced' settings mode, where more details
are shown and accessible by toggling the 'custom' buttons. In the
'advanced' mode you may also apply your changes per 'CPU' instead of
applying it to all CPUs at once. The advanced mode differs between Intel
and AMD, because the MSRs are not standardized (beside the frequency monitoring).

Intel:

AMD:

[image freq3_amd]

When selecting the custom button, you may change even the values in the range
as specified by the CPUs. For details, at the moment, one have to read the AMD
and Intel specification, which is left to the advanced user as exercise ...

Happy tuning !
