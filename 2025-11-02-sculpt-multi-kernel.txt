              Experimental multi kernel Sculpt 25.10 PC image

With the release of [https://genode.org/download/sculpt - Sculpt 25.10] I take the opportunity to publish
also a multi-kernel image version of Sculpt 25.10. Even so not supported
officially, the other capability based microkernels of the Genode OS framework
are in a principal working state also to power Sculpt OS. I crafted and
uploaded an [https://depot.genode.org/alex-ab/images/sculpt_25_10_multi_kernel.img - image]
for interested people, which contains Sculpt 25.10
with the following kernel combinations

* Genode's NOVA kernel version (same as the official PC release)
* Genode's own kernel development, named -hw-
* [https://docs.sel4.systems/releases/sel4/13.0.0.html - seL4 13.0] (mid 2024 release) based kernel version
* [https://hypervisor.org/ - NOVA] 24.52 upstream (end ~2024) based kernel version, named -NOVAe-
* [https://os.inf.tu-dresden.de/fiasco/ - Fiasco.OC] kernel (~2019 version)

Additionally, this image and article kind of wrap up my year of spreading 
Genode's kernel diversity word ;). It started with a short presentation at the
[https://ukvly.org - Systems Meetup Dresden] taking place at the
TU Dresden/Germany in January 2025, where I run Sculpt OS live on Fiasco.OC
during a short presentation. The next event was my presentation at the
open source conference

in Brussels/Belgium in Februray 2025 running Sculpt live on
NOVAe and finally presenting [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N624i4X1UDw - Sculpt on seL4 live]
during my presentation at the

The [https://depot.genode.org/alex-ab/images/sculpt_25_10_multi_kernel.img - image] is a live one, so there is no need for any installation on your PC.
You can copy the image easily to a free available USB stick. Please follow the
[https://genode.org/download/sculpt - official Sculpt documentation] for
help and
[https://genode.org/documentation/articles/sculpt-25-10 - general requirements]
regarding the hardware. Once started, you will be presented with a list
of options presented by the GRUB2 boot loader.

After you selected an entry, the system boots Sculpt with the choosen kernel.
Ideally, if successful, you end up in the Leitzentrale. In the right corner
of the background image the used kernel will be shown. You may also inspect the boot log for
kernel and core (roottask) specific messages during early boot. Beside that,
no optical visible difference is expected across the Sculpt@kernel versions.

You may take the following command line as starting point for experimenting
with Qemu, even so it is not the most efficient nor recommended way:

! qemu-system-x86_64 -display sdl -cpu Skylake-Client -machine q35 -m 3072
!                    -drive format=raw,file=sculpt_25_10_multi_kernel.img
!                    -netdev user,id=net0 -device e1000,netdev=net0
!                    -M q35,accel=kvm,kernel-irqchip=split

You may also enable serial debug output, e.g. via '-serial stdio', if desired.

As a note of warning: not all Sculpt@kernel combinations are expected nor
do work equally well on a principal supported PC. The reasons are manifold,
reaching from missing features (high probability) of a specific combination,
funding, time, manpower, interest ... and so on.

Personally, I was able to start the image with all Sculpt/kernel combinations
on a Lenovo T460p and Lenovo T490 notebook. The used
[https://github.com/alex-ab/genode/commits/sculpt_25_10_multi_kernel/ - branch]
to create the image is available via github.

So, wish you a happy multi kernel sculpting time.
