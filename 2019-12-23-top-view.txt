           Graphical CPU utilization and monitoring tool (19.12)

The [http://www.genodians.org/alex-ab/2019-04-01-top-view - top_view component] is
a tool using the
[https://genode.org/documentation/release-notes/15.08#Enhanced_tracing_facilities - tracing infrastructure] of Genode to gather thread related information, e.g. execution time, and prepare them
for graphical presentation. Lately the tool got some updates I want to share. Beside the textual post I also uploaded a short tutorial [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKIfzPhvRIg - video]. In order to test the current version, you will have to build the [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7g8hDQQt-VI - Sculpt OS image yourself].

In this post I'm going to describe the current - 19.12 version - of
the 'top_view' component and its usage. The 'top_view' tool you may find and
download from my alex-ab depot:

! +
!   -> Depot
!      -> alex-ab
!        -> Tools
!          -> top_view
!          -> top_view_storage

On startup you will have to connect the top_view package with a GUI service,
permit access to the tracing infrastructure of Genode and to the fonts fs
service, available in the genodelabs depot. The top_view_storage variant
additionally needs access to a file system in order to store the traced data.

When the tool starts up, you will get to the initial view:

[image top_view_19_11_1]

The initial view shows per CPU a tiny graph to indicate some ongoing activity
on the CPUs without much detail. By selecting the left configuration button,
you get to thex next view.

[image top_view_19_11_2]

In this view you may adjust the rate of how often the CPU utilization is
measured and updated. The digits of the rate can be changed by left and right
mouse clicks which increases or decreases the update rate.
By selecting the 'enable' button of the list view, you get to the following
view:
 
[image top_view_19_11_3]

The threaded list view on the right presents you the threads with the top most
CPU utilization per CPU. The number of shown threads can be configured per CPU
separately by increasing the number in the specific row. You may also disable
showing some CPUs by de-selecting the associated named CPU button. Most 
olumns you may scroll up/down by using the '...' buttons or the scroll
wheel of the mouse.

You may switch between the default 'thread' and 'components' view by selecting
the so named buttons. The numbers next to the buttons
denote the overall count of threads and components (processes) in the running
Genode system.

In the 'components' view all components (processes) are listed. You may scroll
up/down by using the '...' entries or the scroll wheel. According to the
selected CPU in the left column, the overall utilization of the
threads of a component on the specific CPU is shown. By changing the CPU,
you may get the utilization of the other component threads on that specific CPU.
The column with just the numbers allows you to select how many components at
once are shown.

A click on the thread and label names will lead you to the
detailed component view:

[image top_view_19_11_6]

In the detailed component view you get information specific to a selected
component. The view presents you all threads of a component and the
CPU affinity of them. Additionally, further information regarding scheduling,
like priority and quantum usage is available. The kernel memory usage is
not yet available in Genode upstream.

The checkbox next to each thread will mark a thread to be tracked over
some time. Toggling such a checkbox leads you to an additional 'graph'
window:

[image top_view_19_11_5]

The 'graph' window shows all tracked threads and their CPU utilization per
reading point. The vertical scale denotes the utilization in percent and will
be adjusted automatically to the utilization of the tracked threads. Hovering
above one reading point with the mouse pointer shows the thread and utilization 
information in place. The 'graph' window is resizeable and can be adjusted
dynamically by you.

You may selective de-select tracked threads in the detailed component view
or may de-select all threads at once by using the 'reset' graph button in the
'configuration' view. Whenever no threads are selected for tracking, the
graph window will disappear.

Top_view background
-------------------

The top view package consists of three Genode components running in a 
sub init. The 'top' component gather the trace data and prepare it for
the other two components, the' menu_view' and the 'graph'. Top generates in
the configured period Genode reports understood by the menu_view and by the
graph component.
The menu_view is a modified version of the menu_view as used also in the
Leitzentrale and shows the thread, component, configuration and detailed view.
The 'graph' component is a native GUI/Nitpicker client which presents you
with the second window about the tracked threads.

The latest source code is available on github/alex-ab in branches named
sculpt_pkg_top_view_<date>, e.g. sculpt_pkg_top_view_19_12 for the current version.
